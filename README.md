The Amazon Sales Analysis project involves analyzing a dataset containing sales information for an apparel company that sells its products on the Amazon platform. The primary objective is to gain insights into customer preferences, sales trends, and geographical distribution. The analysis covers aspects such as product size preferences, courier and order status, popular product categories (with a focus on T-shirts), the proportion of B2B versus retail sales, and the geographical sales distribution across different states. Through data visualization and statistical analysis, the project aims to provide recommendations to the company, such as increasing production capacity for high-demand items, strengthening logistics, and exploring growth opportunities in top-performing regions.
